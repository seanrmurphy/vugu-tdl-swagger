# Swagger clients and models

The swagger client and models were generated using the stratoscale variant of the
go-swagger tool.

These were generated a priori and are included directly in the repo; it is not
necessary to regenerate them; however, it is straightforward to regenerate them
using the stratoscale go-swagger tool - using the containerized variant of this
tool is recommended.
